  The key insight is that Emscripten's output (magpie_wasm.mjs) serves double duty - it's both the
  main module AND the pthread worker. There's no separate .worker.js generated by emscripten. Plus,
  Emscripten WASM files can't really be bundled by RSBuild the way wasm-bindgen files can - they need
   to be served as static assets.

  So the packaging approach should be:

  Static files go into liwords-ui/public/wasm/magpie/:
  - magpie_wasm.mjs - Emscripten module (copied from magpie build)
  - magpie_wasm.wasm - WASM binary (copied from magpie build)
  - wasm-worker.js - Application worker (from wasmentry/wasm-worker.js)
  - Plus data files: winpct.csv, english.csv, layouts/standard15.txt

  TypeScript source goes in liwords-ui/src/magpie/ - the API layer that wraps the worker with a typed
   interface.

  No magpie-wasm-pkg/ npm package needed. Unlike wolges (Rust + wasm-bindgen, importable as ES
  module), magpie (C + emscripten, pthreads) needs to load as static files via new Worker().

  The build step would be: make -f Makefile-wasm in magpie, then copy the outputs to
  liwords-ui/public/wasm/magpie/.
