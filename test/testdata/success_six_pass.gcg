#note for some dumb reason, I thought vegetate was spelled with an I, so I traded this instead of playing it. I even said "you're not getting an I," which led to Marlon's next play.

#note I still think that he needs an I. Specifying Marlon's rack, dirt wins the sim by a mile.
>Marlon_Hill: AEEGTTV -VG +0 0
#note When he said "exchange 2" I knew exactly what he was trying to do, and decided that I would have an easier time trying to beat him in a coin flip than I would in a game of scrabble, since he's a better player than me. My only regret is not taking enough time to think about what I was going to do.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: DEGIRRT -DG +0 0
#note okay marlon, let's see what you've got...
>Marlon_Hill: ?AEEOTT (?AEEOTT) -6 -6 
#note Woah! He drew the blank! But I still need to draw my own tiles... I can still win if I draw a 1 point tile and a blank myself.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: EIOQRRT (EIOQRRT) -16 -16 
#note well... so much for that... The game ended here with the score of -16 for me and -6 for Marlon. This ties for the lowest tournament losing score ever... Plus I'm not even upset that it didn't work out. It is worth it just for the story (in my opinion), and I'm going to be telling this one for years to come.
